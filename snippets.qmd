Current quarto file contains a few notes on using the template and offers some snippets of R code for your convenience.

Folder content:  
_xtra folder: square logo and scss file for formatting html.  
_quarto.yml file: project specific formatting for both html and pdf.  

## Snippets

The knitr::purl extracts R code from a quarto file.  
That R code can be sourced.

```{r}
#| label: if_qmd_to_r
#| eval: false
prjct <- 'name_of_qmd_file_to_turn_into_r'
knitr::purl(paste0(prjct,".qmd"), output = paste0(prjct,".r"))
source(paste0(prjct,".r"))
```

Quarto files can be run from terminal, but also from within R with the system().

```{r}
#| eval: false
prjct <- 'name_of_qmd_file_to_run_from_within_r'
system(paste0('quarto render ',prjct,'.qmd'))
```
